# Stray-Tales

Stray-Tales is a modern web application built with **[Next.js](https://nextjs.org)** and **TypeScript**, running on a **Node.js** backend and styled using **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)**. The project uses **[Supabase](https://supabase.com)** as its backend for database, authentication, and image storage.

The platform allows easy creation, editing, and management of animal rescue stories through a clean and intuitive admin panel. Story photos are uploaded and served through Supabase Storage, while secure role-based access ensures that only authorized users can manage content.
